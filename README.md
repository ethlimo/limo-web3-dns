# limo-web3-dns

limo-web3-dns is an experimental domain specific implementation of the DNS protocol for direct resolution of ENS records over DNS. The goal of limo-web3-dns is to allow ENS domain holders to be able to manage traditional services such as web hosting and self hosted software with minimal friction. The ultimate goal of limo-web3-dns is to provide trustless auditable cryptographically signed ENS over DNS to bring ENS to parity with DNS.
